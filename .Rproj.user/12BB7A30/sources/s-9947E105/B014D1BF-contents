\title{Correlation guided Network Integration
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{This is the main function of Correlation guided Network Integration (CoNI). It takes as input data from two sources (e.g. gene expression and metabolite expression). It calculates all pariwise correlations of the elements of the second data input, and also the partial correlations of these pairs with respect to the elements of the first data input. Both data inputs are pre-filtered to include only those elements that significantly correlate. The first data input (typically the largest data input) is also prefiltered to keep only elements with low variance (var<0.5). A modified steiger test is used to identify significant changes between the correaltion and partial correlation values.Results can be visually represented in a Network.
